# VR moral game

I developed a VR moral decision game included psychological factors and I conducted an experiment with 22 participants when I was working at Gbanga.
I presented a poster called "Empathy in VR of the trolley problem compared to paper-based evaluations" at International Conference of Women Scientists and Engineers conference on BT, IT, ET and NT. I got an outstanding poster award.
